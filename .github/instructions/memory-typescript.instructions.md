# Workspace AI Memory - Typescript
This file contains workspace-specific information for AI conversations. Specifically for typescript development.

## Memories
- **2025-08-13 12:59:** In this workspace, always use tabs (not spaces) for indentation in all TypeScript files (.ts, .tsx).
- **2025-08-13 13:27:** For the Copilot Usage History panel, remove legacy charts/tables/debug/storage UI and implement the micro‑MVVM sidebar as planned: Filters, KPI chips, Agents, Models, Activity, Insights. Keep the original Copilot Usage panel unchanged. Populate filter dropdowns from AnalyticsService (top agents/models). Prefer simple list UI over tables and avoid Chart.js in this panel for now.
